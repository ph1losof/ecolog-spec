# Contributing to Ecolog

## Proposing Changes

**For Bug Fixes** (typos, clarifications, contradictions):

- Open an issue describing the problem
- Submit a PR with the fix

**For New Features** (new syntax, behaviors):

- Open an issue for discussion FIRST
- Describe the use case and rationale
- Wait for community feedback
- Submit PR only after consensus

**Important**: Breaking changes require a major version bump (2.0.0).

## Submitting Parser Implementations

If you've implemented an Ecolog 1.0.0 compliant parser:

1. Ensure it passes all test cases
2. Document your implementation
3. Submit a PR adding it to `implementations/README.md`

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful, constructive, and professional in all interactions.
